## Project Description

Student performance prediction can be a valuable tool for educators and institutions. By predicting students' grades or performance, they can identify students at risk of underperforming and take proactive measures. In this project, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict students' final scores based on multiple input features, including:

- Study hours
- Attendance
- Past performance
- Participation in class
- Extra-curricular activities
- Socio-economic background (optional)

The model helps provide insights that can be used to improve educational strategies and help students succeed.
