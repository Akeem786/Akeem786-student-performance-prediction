# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict student performance based on various academic and socio-demographic features using machine learning models. It helps educational institutions identify at-risk students and take proactive steps for academic improvement.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine a student's final grade or performance level using factors like:

- Study time
- Failures
- Absences
- Parental education
- Health status
- and more...

---

## 🔧 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature selection
- Model training using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Predictions on new input data
